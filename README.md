# DesktopBuddy
A little animated character to hang out on your desktop. Gonna make a few versions of this guy

# What he can do right now

There are two Python scripts: `randomFloaty` and `controlFloaty` inside the `floaty` folder

For randomFloaty:
 - You can throw him around, or tell him where to go
 - drag him around with the left mouse, 
 - to command him to go somewhere, right press and drag to another area of the screen, after you release, he will slowly drift in that direction

For controlFloaty:
 - YOU have control, use the WASD to move him around!
 - if you click somewhere else, he will just sit there
 - to control him again, click him, then you can use the keyboard to move him around again
