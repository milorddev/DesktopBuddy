# DesktopBuddy
A little animated character to hang out on your desktop. Gonna make this one pretty robust

# What he can do right now

You can throw him around, or tell him where to go

drag him around with the left mouse, 

to command him to go somewhere, right press and drag to anohter area of the screen, after you release, he will slowly drift in that direction
